1. Take the move_turtle folder from the zip, place it in the src folder in your catkin_ws folder.
2. Run the following cmd command in your catkin folder:
 		source devel/setup.bash 
   This will setup your work environment.
3. Open 2 new terminals in addition to the one you wrote the above command in:
   a. In terminal 2 write the command:
	roscore
      To start ros.
   b. In terminal 3 write the command:
        rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
   c. In the original terminal (That you opened in your catkin_ws folder) write:
        catkin_make --pkg move_turtle
        roslaunch move_turtle move_turtle.launch


If everything was done properly, the turtle will now move 1 meter
and turn 45 degrees before stopping, while printing the location 
to the cmd.
